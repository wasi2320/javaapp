This is a simple java spring App
Firstly i have made a Dockerfile in which it copies .war or .jar files and runs them.
IN the Action workflow 
  1) the code will be pushed to the remote machine
  2) Buld will be made using maven
  3) Dockerfile will run 
  4) Secrets are given for AWS account
  5) It will tag the image and move the image to Amazon ECR repo
  6) I tried using sonarqube but i haven't learnt monitoring tools till know but I will learn them in coming time.
